Abstract: The paper presents an interdisciplinary approach to the treatment of the FormaViva
collection of wooden sculptures exhibited outdoors in a natural environment near the Božidar Jakac
Art Museum in Kostanjevica na Krki in Slovenia. The study focuses on 3D graphic representations of
sculptures created with photogrammetry and 3D modelling. The results are photorealistic renderings,
interactive presentations, 3D printed reproductions, jewellery, and interpretive animations. The
research results show that graphic documentation techniques on 3D models allow for a more detailed
investigation of the original structural identity of the sculpture. By incorporating 3D and interactive
technologies, we are expanding the usability of cultural heritage objects. By using interpretive
techniques that have led to jewellery and interpretive animations in our research, we not only breathe
new life into the sculptures, but also enrich the stories of the sculptures with our own experiences of
the sculptural work.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the rapid developments of digitization have reached cultural heritage.
Technologies such as digital archiving, documentation, and reconstruction, 360◦ capturing,
3D laser scanning, modelling, and printing are influencing the way cultural heritage is
maintained, managed, and preserved, as well as the way it is observed by visitors and
audiences in general. In addition to the technologies, augmented, mixed, and virtual reality
are also increasingly being used in the cultural heritage sector [1].
These new technologies can help increase the reach of cultural heritage. In some
cases, they can extend and expand the life of cultural heritage when its original physical
manifestation is no longer present [1].
Technologies are now financially affordable, and quality is increasing. The decline in
price [2] and the increasing accuracy of 3D printing technologies [3] are now providing
new ways to represent and analyse cultural heritage. This “digital cultural heritage”, also
referred to as “heritage information resource” [4], can extend the life of heritage and become
accessible to everyone.
A cultural heritage is defined by its historical relevance and artistic qualities, but also
by its cultural values, identity, associations, and ability to evoke memories [5].

If we focus on 3D printing of sculptures, this opens new possibilities in the field of
research and accessibility of this cultural heritage.
One of the most important and probably most obvious advantages of 3D printing
is its high flexibility compared to traditional methods of producing copies of sculptures.
Three-dimensional-printed prototypes can be touched without fear of damaging them.
Thus, they represent a new way of interacting with exhibits. There are many factors to
consider if we would like to get as close as possible to the original. For example, we also
need to consider texture, weight, and final appearance, which is sometimes difficult to
achieve with 3D printing [6,7] and “material poetics” may be lost [8].
Three-dimensional capturing technologies and processing methods differ in terms
of accuracy and thus the final results of 3D printing. When we capture with different
technologies, we obtain a point cloud that depends on the accuracy of the capture. During
processing, different filters are used to optimize the digital model, which in turn can affect
the geometry of the model. Metrics obtained by photogrammetry or laser scanning often
contain a lot of noise [3,6].
We can also create 3D prototypes of the exhibits using the 3D modelling process, but
we must be aware that such models are ultimately only an approximation of the original,
as they are the result of interpretation [6].
Each artwork requires a unique approach, especially in the capture of the artwork’s
digital data and data processing. Depending on the characteristics of the artwork, such as
size, construction, material, age, and condition, we determine the conditions for capturing,
equipment and further data processing.
For the capture of wooden sculptures, both photogrammetry and scanning prove to
be reliable capture methodologies. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages,
and the choice of method depends on the sculpture in question [9].
When feasible, computed tomography (CT) could be a valuable examination technique
for 3D visualization and analysis of the internal structure of wooden sculptures (life size),
their construction with various joint materials (nails, dowels of different wood type) or
internal damages (cracks, woodworm tunnels) [10].
New technologies are becoming increasingly important in the field of conservation
for digital records of artworks for research, documentation, reproduction, and treatment
purposes. In certain cases, they can help to reassemble (broken) sculptures [11], or they
can be used for the preparation, virtual sculpting, and printing of missing elements of
artworks [12]. Three-dimensional data of artworks also help in the production of storage
and transport packaging for museum collections [13].
Their use for documentation purposes is probably even more important. They allow
for 3D visualization of most of the details of the sculpture, which are not only viewed
visually, but the 3D models could also be “enriched” with the data obtained from material
analysis (FTIR, micro RAMAN). Such an interactive presentation of the object could serve as
a reference for recording and depicting areas of decay, repair, intervention, and diagnostic
intervention as well as a starting point for further research [14].
Digital approaches to the treatment of cultural heritage are marked by differences
compared to traditional approaches. Although the methods are often combined in practice,
the importance of digitization and its collaboration with machine learning approaches
in documentation, presentation, and interpretation is steadily increasing. Regardless of
the type of approach, the goal in interpretation remains to increase public accessibility to
the heritage object, improve audience understanding, increase participant interest in the
experience, and pleasure and enjoyment [15]. As Knudson states, the goal of interpretation
is “the development of an informed and experienced citizenry in relation to our cultural
heritage”, which requires the interdisciplinary collaboration of experts from various fields
(landscape architects, archaeologists, historians, designers, UX planners, psychologists,
anthropologists, etc.) in implementing interpretive approaches.
Interpretive approaches facilitate both emotional and cognitive engagement of participants with cultural heritage and increased memorability and learning efficiency. Targeted

Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 8445

interpretive approaches also allow for universality of heritage presentation beyond cultural,
sociological, religious, and gender issues. In addition, interpretive approaches contribute to
increased accessibility of cultural heritage, which is consistent with sustainability goals [16].
Interpretive approaches are also responsible for cultural heritage being increasingly
presented in an educational context, even outside of research in archaeology, history, anthropology, cultural studies, computer science, graphic design, didactics, sociology, natural
sciences, etc. At both formal and informal educational levels, interpretive approaches are
being skilfully used to integrate cultural heritage into presentation content and learning
materials [17].
The presented research addresses the collection of Forma Viva’s collection, wooden
sculptures displayed outdoors in a natural environment near the Božidar Jakac Art Museum
in Kostanjevica na Krki in Slovenia.
The conservation of outdoor wooden sculptures is a complex issue, where traditional
conservation approaches are limited. Large sculptures that are in a poor state of preservation require even more technically demanding, laborious and often financially costly
conservation and restoration measures. Although they do not replace physical preservation, new technologies could be beneficial in many ways. For one, they could expand the
conservator’s ability to examine, document, and assess condition. Digitization also allows
us to preserve at least the cultural and historical values of those art objects that cannot
be preserved for various reasons. It can be used as a tool to promote cultural, social, and
economic values, but in doing so, we must respect and protect intellectual property and
work in an interdisciplinary manner [18].
2. Aim of the Research
The goal of the research was to apply digital technologies to selected sculptures from
Forma Viva’s collection. We have developed an interdisciplinary approach to experiment
with new ways of graphic documentation on a 3D model, a visualization that allows
for a clearer representation of the examination of the original structural identity of the
sculpture (technological part: carving, construction, joinery), but also to assess the extent of
deterioration processes and consequently to assess the need for intervention (treatment)
requirements. The method has been shown to be useful for documentation purposes in the
past [14,19].
Experimental work has included digital documentation, digital 3D presentation, and
the introduction of 3D interpretive approaches to wooden sculptures.
The research is presented through case studies of two wood sculptures from the
above-mentioned collection. The two sculptures were created almost 40 years apart, which
indicates the different states of preservation of the two statues. As a result, the treatment of
these sculptures also offers different approaches to the treatment and implementation of 3D
technologies. The first case is Jon Oxman’s Tower of Babel, wood, 480 × 60 × 55 cm (1978),
which has been studied, documented, analysed, and evaluated through visual observation,
but also through digitization, photogrammetry, schematic 3D representation of damage,
interactive 3D presentation, 3D printing, and interpreted into useful objects and interpretive
presentations in audio–visual media (jewellery, animation). The Tower of Babel sculpture
was created in 1978. The sculptor Jon Oxman was born in the United States of America in
1955. He graduated in sculpture and improved his drawing skills, and he studied ceramics.
As for the origin of the sculpture, we know that the inspiration was a well-known myth,
which the sculptor interpreted through the placement of wooden segments and the red
colouring in the areas where the wooden segments move away from the vertical structure.
The second example is Ryszard Litwiniuk’s, Transition, wood, 350 × 350 × 296 cm (2017),
which was modelled, textured, and visualized in 3D. Ryszard Litwiniuk is a Polish sculptor
born in 1966 who works in the fields of sculpture, graphics and installation. The basic
materials of sculpture are wood and stone, which, along with metal, are used in the
Transition statue of 2017. The “Transition” sculpture has a constructivist structure, in the
form of a circle made up of individual segments. This raises the question of time, of cyclical

ing) the outdoor sculptures in the collection, 24 sculptures were selected for capture with
photogrammetry, and 19 sculptures were selected for 3D modelling.
The methodology presented below for the two selected statues was determined on the
basis of multiple attempts at the appropriateness of different approaches in research, art
and didactic (collaboration with students) terms, some of which were also abandoned (e.g.,
3D scanning, application development). The statues considered in this research represent
two “extremes”. A statue exhibited more than forty years ago, Tower of Babel, is heavily
damaged, and its condition has changed significantly from its original form, requiring a
photogrammetric approach to capture it, and Transition, exhibited recently, in which its
good preservation state allowed only for documentation of the existing condition and the
use of 3D modelling for 3D recreation.
The approaches to the sculptures thus represent the optimal framework from documentation to interpretation, which was determined for the selected sculpture based on
two years of interdisciplinary research collaboration among the restoration, computer, and
graphic arts professions.
3.1. Conservation Approach
We carefully assessed the condition of the sculpture, which is important for the
development of the conservation and restoration plan [20]. At the same time, we collected
archival records about the statues and their condition.
The sculptures were documented using traditional conservation in situ sketches (simplified linear drawings), measurements, photographs, video recordings, and written documentation, as well as the process of photogrammetry and 3D modelling, which also served
for further procedures of 3D presentations and interpretations.
After the completion of the 2D graphic documentation of the Tower of Babel, our goal
was to display/transmit the same information on the 3D model (see below).
3.2. Technological Approach
The goal of the technological approach was to obtain the most realistic digital reproductions of the original wooden sculptures. The first step was to digitize the sculptures.
We used 3D modelling and photogrammetry to capture the data of the sculptures. Due to
equipment (scanner) limitations and the size of the outdoor sculptures, 3D scanning was
not possible.
We decided to use 3D modelling for sculptures that would be difficult to capture with
3D photogrammetry (holes, large overhangs) or whose morphology is simple (and therefore
more suitable for modelling). The technological approach also included visualization with
texturing, interactive presentation of the digitized sculptures, and 3D printing of the
selected sculptures.
3.3. Photogrammetry
Photo recording was carried out with UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), i.e., DJI Mavic
Pro Platinum (SZ DJI Technology Co. Ltd., Shenzhen DJI Sciences, Technologies Ltd.,
Nanshan, Shenzhen, China), equipped with a standard 3-channel RGB camera, and handheld digital cameras (Sony alpha a6000 and alpha 7 mk I, Sony, Minato, Tokyo, Japan) for
capturing the parts of the sculptures that were inaccessible for drone recording. For certain
wooden sculptures (exhibited outdoors), the placement of the sculpture (proximity to other
objects such as trees, walls, etc.) also makes it necessary to combine (image) captures
from different devices. The correct import and coordination of the photographs in photogrammetry programs was required further on (for the program to treat them correctly in
terms of focal length, lens, angle, spherical aberrations). The number of drone photographs
averaged 380, and we used between 50 and 150 additional photographs, depending on
the sculpture. Photogrammetry was performed in Agisoft Metashape (Agisoft LLC, Sankt
Petersburg, Russian Federation). Some sculptures required mesh correction, model, and
texture optimization for real-time web presentation after the polygonal mesh was created

The results of 3D graphic documentation and mapping of graphic patterns showing
damage and other conditions are new to the field of documentation and conservation interventions. The usefulness for research can be seen in the further study and investigation
of sculptures, especially with the ability to 3D track the condition of the sculpture over

3.5. 3D Modelling
The process of 3D modelling was applied to sculptures without many organic shapes,
to sculptures with many open parts and to those that are geometrically more regular. Such
sculptures can be easily described with ordinary Euclidean geometry.
Of the two sculptures we used for the study, the Transition sculpture was better
suited for 3D modelling.
The first requirement for modelling was to have the exact dimensions of the parts of
the sculpture. Figure 8 shows a sketch with the dimensions of each part.

The new technologies of 3D printing from new materials, especially metal alloys, are ideal
for the production of jewellery, whether one-offs or micro-series, due to their precision and
material quality.
The design process began with the study of the two selected sculptures, which were
analysed from visual, conceptual, artistic and production points of view, to then explore
their interpretation in a jewellery collection.
In addition, the study of contemporary jewellery design was important. Therefore,
we focused on conceptual jewellery design, where the value lies in the thought process

printing with this polymer, the choice of the angle of layer deposition is important to create
differences in the gloss of the surface of the PLA filament. The perimeter of the filament
used was 1.75 mm, and the layer thickness was 100 microns. The infill pattern was linear in
the horizontal direction with an infill density of 40%. Each layer was printed with three

5. Conclusions
The paper presents an interdisciplinary approach to the treatment of the FormaViva
collection of wooden sculptures exhibited by the Božidar Jakac Gallery (Kostanjevica na
Krki, Slovenia).
The new technologies are not able to replace real artworks/sculptures, but they can
significantly improve the way conservators examine, document, and assess their condition.
Various 3D methods were applied to selected sculptures, which informed the documentation process that serves as the basis of planning preservation. Three-dimensional representations provide more comprehensive records of the physical structure and condition of
the artworks at a given point in time (evidence of their history), which is needed prior to
any intervention. Three-dimensional graphic presentations allow conservators to visualise
certain data that are difficult to achieve with (traditional) 2D presentations, but their use
requires new skills, knowledge, and additional equipment or the necessary collaboration
with other experts, which is not always possible.
Digitization also allows us to preserve at least information about those art objects
that cannot be physically preserved for various reasons. High-quality data can be made
available (digitally) to experts for research or to the public worldwide to promote artworks
in various ways, respecting an artist’s intellectual property.
Interpretive approaches, user-centered design approaches, and storytelling principles
have been applied to 3D representations of statues created with photogrammetry and 3D
modelling. The results are photorealistic renderings, interactive presentations (SketchFab
3D viewer), 3D-printed reproductions, jewellery, and interpretive animations. These
approaches open new ways of presenting the heritage of the wooden statues and, in
particular, their digital conservation, which expands the possibilities for disseminating the
research findings in the public space.
The results of the research show that the procedures of graphic documentation on 3D
models, innovatively introduced in 3D form on wooden heritage objects in this research,
allow for a more detailed investigation of the original structural identity of the sculpture.
This is especially important when artworks are in situ and post-processing the 3D object
with two-dimensional recorded information becomes difficult. By analysing 3D graphic
documents and incorporating 3D and interactive technologies (3D printing, interactive
3D presentations), we expand the usability of cultural heritage objects and create new
modalities of use (tactility, interactivity). By using interpretive techniques that resulted in
jewellery and interpretive animations in our research, we not only breathe new life into the
sculptures, but also enrich the stories of the sculptures with our own experiences of the
sculptural work and the form and expressiveness of the sculptures.
The story of the sculptures was told in an innovative way that has a great impact on
the understanding and personification of the work of art.
