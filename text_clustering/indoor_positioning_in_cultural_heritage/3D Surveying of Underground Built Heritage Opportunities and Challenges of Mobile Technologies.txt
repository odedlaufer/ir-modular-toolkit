Abstract: Among the existing Cultural Heritage settings, Underground Built Heritage (UBH) repre-
sents a peculiar case. The scarce or lack of knowledge and documentation of these spaces frequently
limits their proper management, exploitation, and valorization. When mapping these environments
for documentation purposes, the primary need is to achieve a complete, reliable, and adequate repre-
sentation of the built spaces and their geometry. Terrestrial laser scanners were widely employed
for this task, although the procedure is generally time-consuming and often lacks color information.
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMSs) are nowadays fascinating and promising technologies for map-
ping underground structures, speeding up acquisition times. In this paper, mapping experiences
(with two commercial tools and an in-house prototype) in UBH settings are presented, testing the
different handheld mobile solutions to guarantee an accurate and reliable 3D digitization. Tests
were performed in the selected case study of Camerano Caves (Italy), characterized by volumetric
complexity, poor lighting conditions, and difÔ¨Åcult accessibility. The aim of this research activity is not
only to show the differences in the technological instruments used for 3D surveying, but rather to
argue over the pros and cons of the systems, providing the community with best practices and rules
for 3D data collection with handheld mobile systems. The experiments deliver promising results
when compared with TLS data.

1. Introduction
For almost two decades, reality-based 3D digitization and modelling have been ap-
plied in many Ô¨Åelds, from industries to entertainment and medicine. The 3D digitization
of Cultural Heritage (CH) is also considered a common practice for documentation, conser-
vation, preservation, valorization, and visualization purposes [ 1‚Äì3]. Moreover, 3D data
are an efÔ¨Åcient medium for tourist attractions [ 4,5], for digital archiving and dissemination
of artefacts and monuments to future generations [ 6‚Äì8], or for allowing VR/AR (Virtual
Reality/Augmented Reality) access with mobile devices [9‚Äì14].
Currently, there is a signiÔ¨Åcant variety of 3D acquisition methodologies, but various 3D
digitization activities are being performed with results inferior to those initially expected,
or often without a clear quality check. This is because no 3D data collection technique can
be correctly used without understanding its accuracy potential, limitations, and behavior
under certain conditions. A correct approach to decide which technique is better suited for
a particular situation should be followed, whereas a correct methodology to predict and
compute the quality of the Ô¨Ånal 3D results must also be applied.

Built and natural Cultural Heritage is commonly digitized using image-based and
range-based techniques, where they are often integrated in order to exploit the intrinsic
advantages of each one and overcome possible problems [ 15‚Äì18]. If image and range data
are employed for the 3D digitization of heritage sites or objects, the term reality-based 3D
surveying and modelling is used to distinguish from computer graphics approaches where
Ô¨Åeld measurements are typically not performed [19].
Among the existing CH settings, the Underground Built Heritage (UBH) represents
a peculiar case. The scarce or lack of knowledge and documentation of these spaces
frequently limits their full exploitation and valorization. The complete mapping of this
hidden heritage is the Ô¨Årst step for bridging these knowledge gaps, providing the decision-
makers with a reliable ‚Äúpicture‚Äù of the underground settings. Along with the geological
investigations, the clear and complete representation of these spaces is crucial for investing
in their conservation or planning a new urban function able to meet the space demand of
the modern cities [20‚Äì22].
Nevertheless, mapping the UBH is frequently an arduous task, conditioned by com-
plex environmental and constructive factors which typify these scenarios, like poor il-
lumination, narrow passages, and articulated paths. Moreover, the recurring relevant
dimensions of these underground structures entail acquiring a considerable amount of
3D information that is difÔ¨Åcult to manage and share among the experts involved in the
decision-making process [23].
When mapping these environments for documentation purposes, the primary need is
to achieve a complete, correct, and adequate representation of the built spaces and their
geometry. For a long time, terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) have been widely employed for
this task (Section 2.1), although the procedure is generally time-consuming. In this case,
the registration of multiple scans requires numerous stations, even only to avoid partially
occluded areas, thus producing a huge amount of unmanageable data.
Besides, further colorimetric information is often required for more in-depth analyses
of the masonries and the more faithful restitution of the structures. Image-based techniques
can support this task, although they would demand a notable effort in large and poorly
illuminated environments.
When selecting the suitable technology for UBH documentation projects, additional
needs have to be considered. Firstly, in large and complex underground contexts, the
chosen solution should speed up the acquisition phase and assure the rapid mapping of
the environments. Moreover, the selected technology should result as:
 agile: cumbersome instruments should be avoided in underground contexts with
frequent setbacks and scarce accessibility;
 cost-effective: the best results should be achieved with reasonable costs;
 easy to use: these technologies are also often managed by non-expert staff;
 affordable: CH generally suffers a generalized lack of resources hence, low-cost
solutions are preferable.
For these reasons, handheld Mobile Mapping Systems (MMSs) are nowadays fasci-
nating and promising technologies for mapping underground structures, speeding up the
acquisition times and returning colorimetric information in many cases.
The particular conÔ¨Åguration of these extended underground caves, characterized by
poor and variable illumination, scarce accessibility, and the complex succession of corridors,
narrow passages, and wider rooms makes this site particularly suitable for testing their
performance in such challenging scenarios. All the considered systems are based on
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technologies (Section 2.2), adopting
different strategies (LiDAR and Visual) for tracking the device and mapping the scene.
The data collected were compared with a reference survey performed with Terrestrial
Laser Scanner (TLS), used as the ground truth in the proposed evaluations. The possibility
to compare different ‚Äústate of the art‚Äù portable mobile mapping systems sheds light on
the opportunity offered by fast mapping systems, and opens the debate over new ways to
simplify the UBH documentation and conservation process.

In this paper, we present three mapping experiences in UBH settings (the Camerano
Caves, Italy‚ÄîSection 3.1), testing three different handheld mobile solutions (Section 3.2)
in order to guarantee an accurate and detailed 3D documentation of the UBH site. The
innovative aspects presented in the article include:
1. experiments performed in a real large scenario using a speciÔ¨Åc experimental protocol,
considering both commercial off-the-shelf and prototype solutions as well as visual
and LiDAR methods;
2. an accuracy evaluation performed with the aid of reference ground truth data (based
on TLS acquisitions), which allowed discussion of the costs/beneÔ¨Åts to be argued in a
more reliable way, besides providing quantitative results;
3. results suitable for deÔ¨Åning best practices for exploiting mobile systems in UBH
settings, deÔ¨Åned considering the different factors making such scenarios challenging.
This paper stems from the activities of the Underground4Value (U4V) COST Ac-
tion (CA18110) [ 24], which aims at providing adequate cultural, scientiÔ¨Åc, and technical
knowledge of the Underground Built Heritage (UBH) concerning different aspects (i.e.,
archaeology, geotechnics, history, urban planning, architecture, cultural anthropology,
economics, tourism, sustainable development), in a multi-disciplinary context.
With respect to the special issue in the Sustainability journal ‚ÄúGoing Underground.
Making Heritage Sustainable‚Äù, the article addresses the accurate 3D documentation of a
protected underground heritage site, presenting innovative handheld mobile mapping
tools, lessons learned, and research directions for the preservation and valorization of UBH.

2.1. 3D Digitization of Underground Built Heritage
Underground environments are primarily the result of natural processes and/or
human actions. Over time, these structures have been often exploited with several func-
tions [ 25‚Äì27]. Among the built and natural cavities, some are considered and recognized
as cultural heritage to preserve and valorize, for their particular historical value or the
structure architectural quality. The documentation of these environments is not a recent
activity, although traditional procedures and instruments are nowadays overcome. The
more efÔ¨Åcient reality-based 3D surveying technologies have replaced the old clinome-
ters and compasses used for distance and angular measurements, as well as more recent
tacheometric methods [28].
Among these 3D mapping instruments, the use of terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) has
been broadly explored, especially for the high geometric resolution also achievable in
underground environments [29‚Äì32].
Photogrammetric approaches are also presented in the literature, although their use is
often limited compared to TLS data [ 33,34]. Further works have shown the potential of pho-
togrammetry to document and deeply inspect cavities [ 35], but the applications are often
focused on small underground areas. Despite both technique capability to achieve highly
detailed 3D reconstructions, they require considerable effort when the mapping interests ex-
tended subterranean surfaces. In these cases, a relevant number of scan stations or images
are needed for preventing occlusions and missing 3D data. This can also easily result in a
vast and unmanageable quantity of information to be processed. Moreover, image-based
techniques are frequently penalized by poor or nonuniform lighting conditions, whereas
TLS is scarcely usable in narrow spaces or areas with limited accessibility.
For these reasons, the research community has recently focused on testing more agile
and faster solutions for accurately and entirely documenting these structures with less
effort [ 36]. In the last years, some portable Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) [ 35] have
been tested in underground environments [ 2,37‚Äì42], with promising results in speeding up
documentation in these particular contexts.

2.2. SLAM and Mobile Technologies
In its most generic deÔ¨Ånition, a Mobile Mapping System (MMS) is a mobile survey
platform used to acquire data, optionally geo-referenced, for 3D reconstruction purposes.
The development of these systems began in the late 1980s and, although the Ô¨Årst examples
were mainly vehicle-mounted [ 43], many human-carriable devices have been proposed
so far [ 35]. Compared to static/tripod-mounted survey methods, MSSs can drastically
reduce the working times generally reaching, when used within the supported range and
operational speeds [ 44], a complete object coverage with an accuracy of a few centimeters.
The classical equipment of a MMS consists of three main hardware components: mapping
sensors, navigation/positioning sensors, and a time-referencing unit [ 45]. Mapping sensors
collect environmental information, typically in the form of LiDAR point clouds and/or
RGB/-D images. Navigation/positioning sensors provide positional information of the
device exploiting the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and/or Inertial
Measurements Unit (IMU) sensors. The time-referencing unit synchronizes the data coming
from all the sensors and eventually performs onboard computations and/or optimizations.
In GNSS-denied environments, like underground, satellite positioning is not avail-
able, and the tracking of the platform trajectory is often performed with Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms [ 46‚Äì48]. The goal of these algorithms is
to estimate, solely from onboard sensor data and in real-time, a map of the surrounding
environment, while, at the same time, locating the mobile platform within it. Depending on
the available sensors, SLAM algorithms commonly work on laser scanners (LiDAR SLAM,
e.g., [ 49]) and/or RGB/-D (Visual SLAM, e.g., [ 50,51]) images, also taking advance of IMU
measurements when available. Conceptually, a SLAM algorithm can be decomposed into a
frontend and a backend [ 48]. The former abstracts sensor data into models that are used
to (i) perform short- and long-term (loop closures) data association between consecutive
sensor measurements, and (ii) provide an approximate guess of the device and landmark
positions. The latter tries to reduce the accumulated errors of the frontend via least-square
optimizations on the trajectory graph. The performance of SLAM algorithms is strongly
linked to the scene (presence of texture and light for Visual SLAM and stable and distinctive
geometric features for LiDAR SLAM) and the followed trajectory (distance to the object,
type of movements, moving speed).
3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Case Study
One of the living-labs stemmed from the activities of the U4V COST Action is in
central Italy, where there are many other hypogea with different functions: water reservoir,
military-strategic, food storage, cultural or religious function, and mines or quarries.
Among them, the city of Camerano (Marche region, Italy) represents a local heritage and a
landmark for its network of connected built underground spaces.
The complex environment of the Camerano Caves is a set of halls and tunnels located
below the city center and extends for a total length of 3 km (Figure 1, Figure 2). This
‚Äúunderground city‚Äù has a totally anthropogenic origin, extending under almost all the
historical buildings of the city centre. The full extension of the hypogeum is still a subject
of interest and research today [ 52‚Äì54]: there are also other tunnels and caves far from
the main body with similar characteristics. The Ô¨Årst reliable records date back to 1327.
It seems that their origins are even related to the pre-historical era, but the presence of
new decorative patterns suggests that caves and tunnels were used since the XIX century
by gentry families for reunions and rituals. In 1944, the hypogeum was used as a shelter
from bombardments of World War II by about 2000 people [ 55,56]. The local community‚Äôs
self-initiative and the determination and far-sightedness of the local authority allowed to
differentiate the local tourism offer, leading to success in terms of tourism attractiveness,
with more than 25,000 visitors per year.

Based on physical and structural aspects of this underground environment, which 
are important to highlight for the survey, the floor plan is labyrinthine, and the spaces are 
distributed on different levels in depth. Over time, most of the various underground 
spaces have been joined together, creating co nnecting corridors and staircases that define 
a continuous path. The rooms also vary in size and volume, with an alternation of 
rectilinear and non-rectilinear passages of varying widths, sometimes with niches 
opening at the sides, and leading into larger polygonal or circular spaces. The variability 
of these spaces can also be seen in the un derground pedestrian route, which presents 
numerous changes of direction. The intrados of these underground rooms also vary, such as barrel-vaulted passageways and niches and domed halls. The interi or surfaces of these 
caves are made of friable material, such as sandstone, so they are rough and not smooth. 
The underground complex of the caves is artificially illuminated by small lamps installed along the footpath. The light intensity is subd ued, thus presenting some shadowy spaces.

3.2. Tested Mobile Mapping Systems
In 2019, at the request of the municipality of Camerano, a survey of the caves was car-
ried out with the Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) Z + F Imager 5010 for restoration purposes
and monitoring of some phenomena of damage and degradation. The survey consisted of
317 scans co-registered using markers of known coordinates in a local geodetic network.
The number of points composing the whole dataset is almost 11 mln. An optimized 3D
mesh model at 2 cm spatial resolution was exploited as ground truth to validate the quality
of the point clouds generated by the tested MMSs, described in the following:
 KAARTA Stencil 2‚Äì16 [ 57] is a commercial mobile scanner. It mounts a LiDAR (Velo-
dyne VLP-16), a low-resolution color camera, a low-cost MEMS (Micro Electro Mechan-
ical Systems) IMU, and a computer for real-time processing. VLP-16 has a 360Ô¨Åeld of
Sustainability 2021 ,13, 13289 6 of 18
view with a 30azimuthal opening with a band of 16 scan lines. The data acquisition
is based on setting the conÔ¨Åguration parameters that vary for the type of environment
detected, mainly between outdoor and indoor. These parameters include the voxelSize ,
namely the resolution of the point cloud in the map Ô¨Åle, cornerVoxelSize ,surfVoxelSize ,
sorroundVoxelSize , which indicate the resolution of the point cloud for scan matching
and display, and blindRadius , that is the minimum distance of the points to be used
for the mapping. This laser device is versatile and can be mounted on any mobile
platform. For underground environments, it can be supported by a hand-held pole.
The progress of the scanning can be monitored in real-time via an external monitor
attached with a USB cable.
 GeoSLAM Zeb Horizon [ 58] is a commercial and hand-held mobile scanner, mounting
the same LiDAR and IMU systems of KAARTA Stencil 2‚Äì16. As an accessory, the
ZEB Cam is a color camera for GeoSLAM‚Äôs ZEB Horizon, embedding a Hawkeye
FireÔ¨Çy 8SE action video camera. The image data collected by the camera can be
viewed alongside the 3D point cloud created by the ZEB Horizon and used to extract
contextual information. The process of collecting data using the Zeb Horizon scanning
system is highly automated. The raw laser data is co-registered into a consistent 3D
point cloud by the internal SLAM algorithm, assuming a collaborative scene with
distinctive geometric features. While KAARTA Stencil 2‚Äì16 is able to process data
in real-time, the data acquired by GeoSLAM Zeb Horizon are processed using the
GeoSLAM Hub processing software. Therefore, an additional accessory of GeoSLAM
devices in a data logger to save the acquired data.
 GuPho [ 59] is a research prototype developed by the 3DOM unit of FBK. Unlike the
other two portable MMSs, GuPho is a pure vision device. The 3D reconstruction
is therefore obtained from the acquired images with photogrammetry and dense
image matching. The system is composed of two synchronized stereo cameras, an
embedded pc (Raspberry Pi 4), a smartphone, a battery pack and an illuminator.
GuPho integrates a custom Visual SLAM algorithm based on OPEN-V-SLAM [ 60]
to keep track of the acquisition trajectory, Ô¨Ålter out redundant images, display the
sparse 3D reconstruction of the area in real-time, and provide real-time feedback
and warnings on the image acquisition, such as motion-blur and achieved Ground
Sample Distance (GSD). The Ô¨Ånal dense 3D reconstruction is obtained after the survey,
in post-processing, leveraging the image orientations estimated in real-time by the
Visual SLAM algorithm to speed up the process. Given the narrow and complex
structure of the Camerano caves, the system was conÔ¨Ågured with Ô¨Åsheye lenses (focal
length of 1.85 mm and Ô¨Åeld of view of almost 180) to maximize the view coverage of
the images.
3.3. Data Acquisition and Processing
The considered test area of the caves is shown in Figure 3. It is composed of several
rooms characterized by different geometries, shapes, and illumination, and connected by
both long ‚Äútunnel-like‚Äù sections and narrow passages. The whole area was acquired within
a single SLAM session, except for GuPho where the ‚ÄúCamerone‚Äù part (yellow trajectory in
Figure 3c) was surveyed, due to a temporary access interdiction, with an additional session.
The acquisition trajectories of the three systems are shown in Figure 3, while high-level
metrics of the acquisition are collected in Table 1. The MMSs were conÔ¨Ågured with the
default parameters (only the KAARTA Stencil foresees the indoor preset).

4. Results 
The results of the mapping activity in th e Camerano caves are hereafter presented. 
The dense point clouds obtained with the thre e mobile systems (Section 3.2) were used 
for evaluating their mapping capability in different underground spaces, using the TLS data (point cloud and generated mesh) as grou nd truth. As presented in Section 4.1, a 
different acquisition protocol was followed du ring the surveying campaign, according to 
the characteristics of each technology and th e area to map. Acquired datasets were 
primarily co-registered with the ground-truth TLS point cloud, using the Iterative Closest 
Point (ICP) algorithm for finding the transformation between the reference and source 
point clouds. Therefore, for each of the su b-blocks, the Cloud-to-Cloud (C2C) and the

4. Results
The results of the mapping activity in the Camerano caves are hereafter presented.
The dense point clouds obtained with the three mobile systems (Section 3.2) were used
for evaluating their mapping capability in different underground spaces, using the TLS
data (point cloud and generated mesh) as ground truth. As presented in Section 4.1, a
different acquisition protocol was followed during the surveying campaign, according
to the characteristics of each technology and the area to map. Acquired datasets were
primarily co-registered with the ground-truth TLS point cloud, using the Iterative Closest
Point (ICP) algorithm for Ô¨Ånding the transformation between the reference and source
point clouds. Therefore, for each of the sub-blocks, the Cloud-to-Cloud (C2C) and the
Cloud-to-Mesh (C2M) distances were computed to evaluate each solution‚Äôs behaviour
in different underground environments. For the evaluation, some metrics and/or visual
analyses are proposed, considering sub-blocks with similar environmental features of the
‚ÄúCorraducci‚Äù cave (Figure 4), and in particular:

The comparison of sub-block 4 is done with visual analyses, because of the variable
completeness of the acquired data due to the chosen acquisition protocol focused on
containing the mapping time, rather than completely surveying this articulated area.
Metrics and visual analyses show that all the MMSs were able to rapidly acquire
the main geometry of the caves with errors ranging between 1 and 3 cm, although some
technologies proved to be more effective and less sensitive to the peculiar environmental
characteristic of this scenario. More speciÔ¨Åcally, the dark and uneven environmental
illumination did not allow the photogrammetric GuPho system to match the acquisition
speed of the other two systems (Table 1), or to reconstruct all the niches more completely.
This is more evident in the large dodecagonal room where, despite having followed similar
trajectories of the other two MMSs (Figures 8 and 9), the illuminator was not strong
enough to adequately light the niches. Nevertheless, the integrated motion-blur control
and automatic image selection worked properly and the 3D results obtained with GuPho
are in line with the other two commercial systems.

5. Discussion
Quantitative and qualitative comparative analyses were performed unveiling new
arguments of discussion for UBH surveying strategies that are worth highlighting. The
experiments, in fact, provide a great number of suggestions for users interested in undertak-
ing strategies for the management and conservation of these fascinating settings. Indeed,
considering 3D survey as the starting point for each intervention and/or decision-making
process, the comparative study here presented paves the way for deÔ¨Åning best practices
in future acquisition campaigns. To do so, the comparison performed is multifaceted, as
it considers off-the-shelf systems vs. a research prototype, range-based vs. image-based
systems, and mobile vs. static systems.
The Ô¨Årst point of discussion is about the acquisition and processing time. For all three
MMSs, it can be stated that the acquisition time was strongly reduced when compared with
that of TLS. The difference moves from some days to a few minutes of walking. The range-
based systems (namely, KAARTA Stencil 2‚Äì16 and GeoSLAM Zeb Horizon) outperformed
the image-based, which requires the user to move slowly to achieve a complete mapping.
This is due to the illumination conditions and the complexity of the environments, which
hamper the user to speed up the walking phase (in total, the acquisition time is four times
higher with visual SLAM, see Table 1). Even the post-processing phase is faster for the
commercial solutions: ad hoc software allows to get in output a ready-to-use product,
while the Visual SLAM requires a photogrammetric suite to achieve the Ô¨Ånal dense cloud
Sustainability 2021 ,13, 13289 14 of 18
(Table 1). Conversely, the color information is completely missing for the Stencil 2, while it
is possible to achieve a colored point cloud with the Zeb Horizon (by exploiting the video
stream), and, obviously, with the photogrammetric GuPho system. It must be said that
the achieved acquisition time obtained with the KAARTA and GeoSLAM Zeb Horizon
devices were the result of an acquisition strategy that relies upon the LiDAR data and
was therefore not optimized for the image acquisition. Therefore, the gap between the
time required for the acquisition using LiDAR and visual-based SLAM technology would
reduce signiÔ¨Åcantly in the case where a properly coloured point cloud would be necessary.
In such a case, the problems faced by GuPho would be common to all the devices used (for
example, with respect to image blur or unevenly lit surfaces). This Ô¨Årst analysis is in line
with the literature [ 41]. Many papers state that MMSs are suitable for their efÔ¨Åciency in
indoor spaces and articulated architectural, landscape, and archaeological settings where
GNSS positioning is not available. Besides, with respect to the TLS compartment, both
range- and image-based solutions are more rapid in both acquisition and processing (this
consideration is mainly addressed to the automatic pre-process of clouds, as seen when the
marked time trajectory must be carefully manually controlled). Broadly speaking, UBH are
considered ‚Äúunfriendly environments‚Äù for surveyors hence, handheld portable MMSs are
recommended due to their compactness and handiness.
This Ô¨Årst recommendation, however, has to be evaluated depending on the output
product needed for representing the scene. If the committed by-product is a 2D represen-
tation, considering the comparisons in sub-blocks 1‚Äì2-3 (Figure 4), the Stencil provides a
standard deviation suitable for a 1:200 representation, while the Zeb Horizon and GuPho
allow to increase the scale up to 1:100. The more the trajectory increases in length, the
less the architectural details can be validated. For the full availability and handling of
architectural details, a scale of 1:50 or above is required, and more accurate clouds derived
from the TLS technique continue to be needed [ 38]. Conversely, if the results are conceived
for an overall 3D representation of the scene, the geometric information derived with a TLS
acquisition might be redundant. For both (H)BIM and virtual representations, the accuracy
of the MMSs is compliant with the Ô¨Ånal purpose, as conÔ¨Årmed in the literature [ 61]. Of
course, this aspect is normally case-speciÔ¨Åc, and there is not a generalizable approach for
the different existing UBH [20].
This latter comment, open to the great issue related to the inner factors of an UBH:
they can be natural or built, leading to several variables that are here discussed. The
models obtained with image-based MMSs have a higher resolution and point density than
those acquired with GeoSLAM [ 62]. However, this statement can be partially contested
if one considers the illumination. As shown in the comparison made for the sub-block 4
(Figures 8 and 9), niches with very low artiÔ¨Åcial illumination show missing data that have
instead been collected by the range-based solution. However, the performances of the latter
(and speciÔ¨Åcally for the Stencil) were badly affected by the scarce illumination, in terms of
trajectory. As depicted in Figure 3, the Stencil loses the orientation, and the sole LiDAR
sensor is not sufÔ¨Åcient to maintain the path for long walks. For this reason, it would be
meaningless to perform the comparison for the whole point clouds, and the dataset was
split into key representative areas [63].
A few last comments are deserved for the data quality (considering both spatial and
radiometric resolutions). The LiDAR devices deliver noisier data, however, the noise ob-
served in measurements performed with the Zeb Horizon is lower than the noise observed
in the Stencil cloud. This aspect is known and conÔ¨Årmed in similar papers (where generally
more than 90% of the deviations between the clouds are less than 5 cm) [ 64]. In the case of
Camerano settings, our Ô¨Åndings demonstrate that image-based solution delivers a dataset
with less noise, comparable with the TLS [ 65]. The lack of high-quality radiometric data
is still an unsolved issue for LiDAR-based solutions. Indeed, images can be projected on
the surface points in post-processing and this can facilitate the point matching for scan
registration, segmentation and other analyses of the clouds. The GuPho prototype delivers
Sustainability 2021 ,13, 13289 15 of 18
a superior quality of radiometric information. LiDAR MMSs require a post-processing
phase for colouring the cloud, but still with scarce results [66,67].
6. Conclusions
In this paper, a comparative study between commercial handheld mobile off-the-shelf
and in-house solutions was performed. The objective was to provide the research commu-
nity with updated information about the possibility offered by new 3D mobile technologies,
instruments, and algorithms for the realization of 3D surveys. The chosen environment
was the UBH of Camerano (Italy) within the framework of the U4V COST action. Our
experiments were not devoted to Ô¨Ånding the winning solution, but rather to deÔ¨Åne best
practices for different users, interested in undertaking 3D documentation, conservation and
valorization strategies for underground settings. Besides the documentation and digitiza-
tion purposes, especially for the preservation of the UBH, the 3D mapping was used to test
and validate some well-known and promising technologies in such particular scenarios.
The experimental protocol was set considering a TLS survey as the ground truth, and
peculiar areas of the whole caves have been analyzed in detail. Results have shown shelf
that LiDAR-based solutions are most suitable for non-expert users, as they provide reliable,
fast, and ready-to-use data, which require little expertise in data processing. Image-based
solutions, instead, return very detailed and complete reconstructions, at the expense of
slower and more complex acquisition and processing tasks. The commercial solutions, of
course, are more expensive, and this could result in a bottleneck for the Cultural Heritage,
which notoriously suffers from a lack of investments. The GuPho prototype here presented,
given the low cost of its hardware, is a straightforward solution, despite the fact that the
owners of these environments should rely on some training of its staff for a full exploitation
of the tool.
More in general, the 3D mapping of Cultural Heritage is essential for undertaking
decisions for the management of UBH. A clear analysis of the needs should be done a
priori, in order to decide the best surveying approach on the basis of the results shown.
The presented activities allowed, in fact, to highlight limitations and open research
issues in the 3D digitization of UBH: image-based approaches suffer from illumination
conditions and lack of texture, suggesting more robust key-point detectors and descriptors;
trajectory drifting could be reduced using more powerful and reliable SLAM methods
that fuse other sensor information, such as from inertial and magnetic sensors; and auto-
mated methods are needed to transform the collected 3D point-clouds in more usable 3D
information models.
Another important aspect not directly related to Geomatic is the existing knowledge
gaps that communities should acquire, by gaining speciÔ¨Åc competencies and skills that are,
nowadays, externalized. Local communities too often lack scientiÔ¨Åc and technical knowl-
edge, technological capabilities, and Ô¨Ånancial resources for the satisfactory conservation
and re-use of UBH sites. In particular, they demand for surveys to understand complex
damage and decay mechanisms, long-term environmental processes, and medium- to
short-term natural, human, and ecological risks. Without surveys and monitoring tools that
are missing or considered too costly, many underground sites that once lost their original
function frequently remain as hidden and forgotten landscapes, lying abandoned and in
a bad state of conservation. Therefore, Ô¨Ålling knowledge gaps and building capacity at a
local level represents a major challenge for UBH, and the work here proposed raises new
points for discussion that need to be considered by the administrations.
Data collected in this case study will be shared within the project dissemination plan
to promote the Camerano caves‚Äô knowledge and fruition. This will be done with an ad
hoc platform where, besides visualizing the obtained point clouds in 3D, the user will
compare by himself the results of the presented comparison. Future efforts will be put
into the exploitation of information modeling of the acquired data. The digital reality-
based 3D model can be converted into a crucial reference frame for the understanding,
monitoring, and management of documentation, thus creating a data source (graphics
Sustainability 2021 ,13, 13289 16 of 18
and semantics) that is suitable for assisting in conservation, preservation, and restoration
projects, implementing Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM) products. Even
today, in the practice of the restoration and preservation of Built Cultural Heritage (BCH),
the (H)BIM tool is still not widespread and often used as advanced CAD, neglecting its
essence: information and its sharing. Finally, additional spherical photos acquired along
the underground path will integrate the remote visit to these structures, allowing the user
to experience a virtual tour in the hidden Camerano treasure.
