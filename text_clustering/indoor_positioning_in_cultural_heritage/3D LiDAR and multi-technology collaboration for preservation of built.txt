Literature review 
Research progress ABSTRACT  
In recent years, the technical application of 3D LiDAR has gradually expanded to the field of built heritage. 3D 
scanning, high-precision measurement, and reconstruction have enriched the methods of built heritage preser -
vation and significantly improved the quality of heritage preservation in China. 3D LiDAR has broken through 
the limitations of a single technology application and played a greater role in the field of heritage preservation on 
different scales. Through the collaboration of multi-technology, such as 3D printing, digital mapping, internet of 
things, machine learning, intelligent sensors, close-range photogrammetry, infrared detection, stress wave to-
mography, material analysis, XR technology, reverse engineering, etc., 3D LiDAR shows its technological ad-
vantages on exploring the remote real-time monitoring and digitization of the built heritage, geological and 
environmental data collection, prediction of sedimentation, deformation monitoring, weather monitoring,system 
life cycle health detection, digital reproduction of built heritage for developing scientific problems and engi-
neering practices such as building contour recognition, information feature matching, structural reinforcement 
and damaged component replacement. In addition, through the docking with GIS, HBIM, XR, and CIM, it pro-
vides fine digital models and high-precision data benchmarks which contribute to the heritage visual repro -
duction; and through the docking with 3Ds Max, SketchUp, and other modeling software, it has contributed to 
the renewal design of the built heritage, space optimization, and the scientificity and rationality of the heritage 
value evaluation. However, past technology applications also highlighted many problems such as limited 
recorded information, a large amount of data, high difficulty in collaboration, non-standardized and fragmented 
data, and difficulty in data mining and comprehensive utilization. There are still deficiencies in building a built 
heritage data backplane, and the development of a dynamic, three-dimensional, intelligent and refined heritage 
monitoring system, and further research is needed on these issues. This study reviews the previous academic 
progress and application of 3D LiDAR in the reconstruction of built heritage and multi-technology collaboration 
in the process of preservation, clarifies the current research hotspots and methods, the frontier issues of concern, 
and also clarifies the specific problems and challenges in the future.   
1.Introduction 
Built heritage mainly covers three parts: architectural heritage, 
urban heritage, and landscape heritage, which have both material and 
social properties (Li, 2019 ). Built heritage constitutes the uniqueness 
and identity of a place, it is a non-renewable resource and can be 
vulnerable to change (Phillips, 2015; Organ, 2019; Tan, et al., 2020; 
Azmi, et al., 2021 ). As the physical carrier of regional space history, it plays a significant role in the continuation of the urban context, local 
characteristics, and collective memory (Wang et al., 2016; Vaz de 
Freitas, et al, 2022 ). In recent years, built heritage has faced many 
problems and challenges, such as deformation caused by environmental 
degradation, erosion, and collapse caused by natural disasters, excessive 
human intervention in the process of preservation and development, and 
inappropriate replacement of materials and colors in the process of 
restoration (Coombes, et al., 2021 ). A series of problems emerged, such

2as the disappearance of real historical and cultural information and the 
reduction of the historical value of heritage. In China, under the guid-
ance of many principles such as authenticity, integrity, identifiability, 
readability, and sustainability, the practice of built heritage preserva -
tion is committed to the goal of maximum preservation and minimum 
intervention, while new technologies development and application play 
a key role in this process. 
3D LiDAR has been an active research area in the photogrammetry, 
computer vision, and computer graphics communities, and it is con-
cerned with several fields of the urban environment, cultural heritage, 
environmental monitoring, mapping, and modeling (Wang, 2013; Di 
Stefano et al., 2021 ). As a new mapping technology, 3D LiDAR is widely 
used in the field of built heritage preservation. It considers the advan -
tages of high data acquisition efficiency and an accurate point cloud 
model, presenting a fine hierarchical structure at the level of modeling 
details of the built heritage (El-Hakim et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2020 ). At 
present, this technology has been widely used in high-precision 3D 
modeling of cultural heritage sites, digital mapping, heritage display, 
building ontology preservation, repair, structure precision measure -
ment, archiving, digital basic database construction, industrial reverse 
engineering, virtual reality, and other fields. However, the preservation 
of the built heritage has the characteristics of multidisciplinary, multi- 
scale, complexity. A single type of application is difficult to meet the 
heritage preservation integration, all-round, multi-level, and structured 
requirements. 3D LiDAR-based technology collaborative methods 
become more adapted to the different types, scales, and structures of 
built heritage and important research direction. 3D LiDAR and multi- 
technology cooperation refer to the practice of taking 3D LiDAR as the 
main technology and combining 3S technology, 3D virtual reality, 3D 
printing, big data, and other technical means to carry out cooperation in 
the preservation process. The technology combination has flexibility 
and extensibility in realizing digital preservation of built heritage, 
display interaction, virtual restoration and reconstruction, authenticity, 
integrity, suitability, sustainable heritage environment optimization, 
and many other aspects. Based on the above discussion, it is necessary to 
review the 3D LiDAR and multi-technology cooperation in the field of 
built heritage preservation. 
This literature review critically reviews the papers in Chinese from 
the time span of 2012 to 2022, summarizing the academic research and 
specific practice of 3D LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration in the 
preservation of built heritage. The contribution of this literature review 
is as follows: (1) this paper sheds the light on the current application of 
3D LiDAR, including the problem-solving exploration, and the paradigm 
of collaboration with other technologies, which helps to establish a 
systematic understanding of the application of 3D LiDAR technology in 
the field of built heritage preservation. (2) through the analysis of many 
cases on built heritage preservation, this paper summarized the research 
progress of 3D LiDAR in collaboration with multiple technologies and 
presented the technical difficulties. (3) through the literature review, 
this paper highlighted the technical and methodological limitations, 
moreover, provided the future possibilities of technological application. 
2.Data sources and study methods 
To identify relevant studies, the authoritative citation databases 
based on the CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) academic 
platforms such as the Core journal directory of Peking University (PKU), 
CSSCI database (Significant Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences 
in Chinese), and CSCD database (Significant Journal of Science and 
Technology in Chinese) were adopted. This literature review mainly 
considers built heritage-related papers, focusing on the academic studies 
and practices of the 3D LiDAR and multi-technology cooperation in the 
field of built heritage preservation in China. The time is taken from 2012 
to 2022, namely, take the recent 10 years as a periodic summing-up 
work. The papers collected in the above-mentioned databases are of 
high academic value and have good authority and reliability. The research data acquisition process is as follows: Firstly, based on the CNKI 
academic platform, this study selects high-quality papers from the Core 
journal directory of Peking University, CSSCI, and CSCD databases 
based on the search item, the first search term is “laser scanning ”, 
moreover, “heritage ”, “3D LiDAR ”, and “preservation ” were used as the 
second search term. Secondly, according to the research topic of this 
literature review, the retrieved Chinese literature was manually 
screened and classified. Finally, 265 papers were selected as the basic 
data for this review. 
Based on clarifying the technical application background and current 
situation, the study makes an overall literature review of the selected 
Chinese papers. The specific research steps are as follows: First, use the 
bibliometric method and the statistical functions of CNKI to analyze the 
interannual distribution of bibliographic data. The distribution of aca-
demic journals, the distribution of disciplines, the distribution of re-
searchers and their institutions, research hotspots, research issues, and 
research methods distribution are descriptive statistics, aiming to 
comprehensively present and clarify the progress of existing research in 
3D LiDAR combined with built heritage preservation in China; Second, 
use the citation space method, the bibliometric visualization tool VOS-
viewer is used to sort out the hotspots, technical methods, and analyze 
the research density of Chinese papers; Third, conduct a comprehensive 
review of the multidisciplinary application of 3D LiDAR, the hotspots 
and methods of 3D LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration from 
multi-scale; Finally, based on the summarization, analysis, and com-
parison of the selected papers to give a discussion of the future challenge 
and future technological application, and the reference is drawn for the 
follow-up research. 
3.Quantitative analysis of the statistical characteristics of the 
selected papers 
3.1. Interannual distribution of papers 
From the annual distribution of documents after 2012, the literature 
on 3D LiDAR and built heritage preservation collected by the Core 
journal directory of Peking University, CSSCI, and CSCD began to in-
crease (Fig. 1), and then basically showed a trend of small increase year 
by year. After 2016 –2017, the literature began to increase significantly; 
After 2017, it showed a trend of gradual decline, but the number of 
literature remained around 33–41 papers, which to some extent in-
dicates that academic attention on the combination of 3D LiDAR and 
built heritage preservation has not decreased in recent years, and rele-
vant research results have maintained a steady growth momentum.

33.2. Distribution of journals and disciplines 
From the perspective of source publications (Table 1), the top 10 
journals in the number of Chinese papers published mainly focus on the 
five most representative disciplines of surveying and mapping, laser, 
cultural preservation, remote sensing, and architecture to carry out 
relevant research on built heritage preservation. Among the significant 
journals, Bulletin of Surveying and Mapping and Laser Journal occupy the 
first two places in terms of the number of published papers, focusing on 
the practical application of built heritage preservation, and covering 
more types of heritage at macro and meso scales. However, the paper 
published in cultural preservation and architecture journals focuses on 
the digital preservation of heritage sites at a mesoscale and microscale, 
and the number of articles published is far behind that of surveying, 
mapping, and laser journals. the advantages of this discipline need to be 
further released in subsequent studies. overall, the papers published in 
these journals cover the multi-disciplinary and multi-scale characteris -
tics of built heritage preservation and are based on the discussion of 
multiple data sources, multi-technology combinations, key technolo -
gies, and technology applications, reflecting the trend of technological 
collaboration and disciplinary integration of research. 
4.Hotspots and methods of 3D LiDAR for built heritage 
preservation 
The preservation of built heritage possesses the traits of complexity, multi-scale, and multi-discipline. First of all, each field of study has 
unique viewpoints and methods for tackling particular issues. In terms of 
3D LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration, the differences in the 
built heritage at macro, meso, and micro scales need to fill the needs of 
heritage preservation at different sizes. Thirdly, the authenticity and 
integrity of the preservation process, as well as the materiality and so-
ciality of the architectural heritage, set extremely high standards and 
demands for the use of 3D LiDAR. Due to the aforementioned traits, 3D 
LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration have emerged as crucial tools 
for resolving multi-disciplinary, multi-scale, and complicated problems. 
The existing research shows a wealth of technology application and 
investigation through its inter-annual variance in research hotspots and 
methodologies, the tendency of technology selection, and emphasis on 
application density. 
5.Research hotspots of 3D LiDAR in the field of built heritage 
preservation 
In Chinese publications from 2012 to 2021, research hotspots for 3D 
LiDAR in the field of built heritage preservation are displayed in Fig. 2 
and Table 2. Digital mapping, point clouds, Lidar, monitoring of 
deformation, geological hazards, repair and reconstruction, 3D 
modeling, technological fusion, virtual reality, information display, etc. 
are some of the hotspots for research. It is worth noting that on the 
technical side, the combination of 3D LiDAR with a wider range of 
disciplines and their technologies provides more problem-solving solu-
tions for built heritage preservation; on the outcome side, the research 
seeks a more multidimensional orientation based on heritage preserva -
tion, including spatial optimization, database construction, innovation 
in image processing techniques and human experience. The research 
focus is shifting from single technology application to multi-discipline 
and multi-technology integration, and the research content is not 
merely recording the current situation. In addition to laser technology & 
equipment research and built heritage research, interdisciplinary 
research with archaeology and anthropology is also a new trend in 
recent years (Wei et al., 2013). 
The keywords extracted from the Chinese literature in Table 2 can be 
summarised as (1) types of built heritage; (2) distribution of built her-
itage; (3) conservation practices of built heritage; (4) technological in-
novations and applications of built heritage, and (5) data processing of 
built heritage, etc. These keywords, combined with 3D LiDAR, present 
the current conservation practices and technological innovations of the 
academic community at different scales and types of heritage sites and in 
the framework of different combinations of technological tools in a 
multi-technological collaboration. In addition, Table 2 shows that 3D 
LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration have been applied to 
different scales and types of built heritage, but there is variability in the 
combination of technical tools, and in the process of preservation 
practice, some scholars have also tried to seek breakthroughs in recon -
struction, monitoring, digital representation and simulation, machine 
identification, boundary extraction, and 3D printing. More notably, the 
research focus of 3D LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration in Chi-
nese publications are shifting from technology applications to big data, 
artificial intelligence, cognition, and emotion. 
5.1. 3D LiDAR methods used in built heritage preservation 
The key technical approaches used in the Chinese study for the 
period of 2012 to 2022 (Fig. 4) are 3D LiDAR, UAV, 3S technology, XR 
technology, 3D printing technology, and artificial intelligence technol -
ogy. Additionally, the technical collaboration in software mostly utilizes 
the modeling and drawing programs Revit/BIM, 3Ds Max, CAD, and 
Agisoft PhotoScan and involves algorithms, close-range photography, 
tilt photogrammetry, virtual presentation, measurable real image, etc. In 
terms of technological application, it has been discovered that the model 
of 3D LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration is more adaptable in Table 1

4solving professional difficulties and can provide more targeted research 
plans; the model of 3D LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration is also 
more adaptable in terms of data management. In terms of interdisci -
plinary, complicated, and comprehensive research themes that can also 
be coordinated through 3D LiDAR and multiple technologies, it can 
better match with the data storage and management functions of BIM/ 
HBIM and GIS/HGIS and play a supportive role in the research process. 
The model provides an in-depth discussion for research, on the devel -
opment path, the model of 3D LiDAR and multi-technology collabora -
tion has started to be tightly integrated with the environmental behavior 
science and psycho-behavioral science of built heritage sites. 
In Chinese publications, there are relatively extensive studies on the 
use of mobile communication systems, thermal imaging cameras, and 
3D laser scanning in the preservation of constructed heritage, which is 
frequently employed in preservation projects. Some academic confer -
ences and forums on spatial information technology on cultural heritage 
preservation in China have already displayed mature technology ap-
plications; in addition, the English paper that combines MATLAB and 3D 
laser scanning in the research on built heritage preservation is worthy of 
further discussion. Additionally, more research needs to be done 
regarding the degree of multidisciplinary integration. In general, the 
technical application of Chinese papers displayed through the VOS 
viewer knowledge graph has maintained a roughly synchronized state in 
the past 10 years. 
5.2. The technical application density of 3D LiDAR in the field of built 
heritage preservation 
In Chinese literature from 2012 to 2022, point cloud data, digitiza -
tion, 3D modeling, 3D virtual reality, close-range photogrammetry, 3D 
modeling, virtual visualization, 3D printing, and other technical appli -
cations related to the preservation of built heritage are concentrated. The density of technology applications in the Chinese literature is 
concentrated in laser applications, scanning, close-up photogrammetry, 
and 3D modeling, while the rest of the technology applications are more 
evenly distributed around 3D laser scanning. 
Through the aforementioned technical methods and their annual 
changes and technical application density (Fig. 5), it can be found that 
the Chinese studies have the following characteristics in terms of tech-
nical methods: First, from focusing on the ontology of architectural sites 
and ontology-environment complexes (Wan et al., 2020 ) to the coordi -
nated observation of air-land-space integration, the internet of things, 
display interaction, perception and computing involving the preserva -
tion of built heritage; Second, from a single technology application to a 
comprehensive research of multi-technology integration, such as the 
combination of 3D LiDAR and 3Ds Max, 3D printing technology, and XR 
technology, applied to virtual scene construction, public archaeology, 
virtual restoration and reconstruction (Geng et al., 2021 ); The combi -
nation of laser scanning and 3S technology, HBIM and heritage big data 
is applied to the construction of heritage data platform and the moni -
toring and management of heritage sites; the combination of 3D LiDAR 
and artificial intelligence technology is used to explore semantic seg-
mentation, image matching, feature extraction, image processing, etc. 
Overall, the Chinese paper focuses on 3D scanning systems, 3D 
reconstruction, 3D modeling, information display, digital mapping, and 
close-range photogrammetry; in terms of methods; the technical 
collaboration of Chinese paper in software is mainly GIS, Revit/BIM, and 
3D modeling software, and involves computer programming algorithms, 
3D virtual scenes, close-up photography, oblique photogrammetry, 
virtual display, measurable live images, etc. In the past 10 years of 
Chinese papers, “high-precision modeling ”, “digital surveying and 
mapping ”, “virtual simulation ”, “information display ” etc. are the 
research hotspots in the field of built heritage preservation. The com-
bination of “big data ”, “artificial intelligence ”, “machine learning ”,

be seen as the current focuses in this field. 
6.Application of 3D LiDAR and Multi-Technology collaborative 
in the preservation of built heritage 
6.1. Digital application on built heritage preservation with Multi-Scale, 
Multi-Purpose, and Multi-Technology docking 
After more than 20 years of development, 3D LiDAR hardware has 
made great progress in stability, accuracy, and ease of operation, espe-
cially in airborne, vehicle-mounted, and ground 3D LiDAR. Based on the 
collected Chinese papers, this study selects representative papers to 
present the application and current technological progress in order to 
clarify the multi-purpose and multi-technology docking of 3D LiDAR at a 
multi-scale. 
On the macro scale, Hu Yaofeng, et al. (2016) carried out research 
on key technologies for the census of immovable cultural heritage based 
on 3S technology and studied the census standards for immovable cul-
tural heritage, the “three lines ” of cultural relics, and mobile terminal 
equipment. Basic analysis systematically discusses the application of 3S 
new technologies in the census, such as 3D LiDAR technology, 
measurable scene image technology, and mobile GIS, and verifies the 
superiority of 3S technology in the census through a successful case; 
Liang Shuang, et al. (2016) researched the key surveying and mapping 
techniques for the Qin and Shu ancient road heritage; Wang Bing, et al. 
(2017) combined 3D LiDAR and close-range photogrammetry to 
construct an internal and external information database of the Great 
Wall of Ming Dynasty, which improved data acquisition capabilities; 
Huo Pengpeng, et al. (2020) used a variety of data sources in the 3D 
reconstruction method of the Ming Great Wall in Beijing, used Con-
textcapture Center software for data processing to construct Mesh 3D models, and used medium and long-range 3D laser scanners. The 
elevation information of the Great Wall is determined from the point 
cloud, and the Great Wall and its appendages are modeled in turn in 3Ds 
Max software and exported in a common format to ensure its 
universality. 
On the mesoscale, Xie Jinpeng, et al. (2015) combined 3D LiDAR 
technology with AutoCAD, 3D Max, and SketchUp to build a digital 3D 
model for the preservation of Kaiping Diaolou, serving 3D image 
reconstruction of the Diaolou building. Wang Chenyang, et al. (2016) 
explored a fast and high-precision modeling method for built heritage by 
combining 3D LiDAR, archival data, and SketchUp; The same method 
was applied to the point cloud registration and in terms of modeling 
methods, Cui Xiaolei, et al. (2021) used 3D LiDAR to 3D digitize ancient 
buildings, including three major processes: image point cloud data 
acquisition, point cloud data processing, and 3D model creation. Among 
them, the building point cloud data is scanned and collected by the 
Trimble TX5 3D laser scanner, and then the data is processed by the 
Trimble Real Works software that is matched with it, and then the 
ancient buildings are constructed in 3D through modeling software such 
as 3Ds Max and SketchUp; In 2017, to find out the occurrence and 
development of the disease of the Three Pagodas of Chongsheng Temple, 
accurately assess the preservation status of cultural relics, and improve 
the digital management level of cultural heritage, with the support of 
Yunnan Provincial Bureau of Cultural Relics, Dali City Cultural Relics 
Preservation and Management Institute cooperated with Shanghai 
Jianwei Libao Engineering Technology Co., ltd. has launched the 
Internet of Things remote real-time monitoring and digitization project 
for the Three Pagodas of Chongsheng Temple. The preservation status 
and risks faced by the Three Pagodas of the Holy Temple were moni -
tored in real-time, a real-time early warning system for cultural relics 
safety was established, and a cultural relic monitoring and digital 
management platform was constructed. Yu Peiyong, et al. (2018) ,

6relying on the restoration and preservation project of Zhu De’s former 
residence, used close-range photogrammetry technology and 3D laser 
technology to build a fine 3D model, digitally preserved the former 
residence of the great man, and elaborated on the ancient architecture 
based on 3D LiDAR technology. The refined digital modeling process 
provides an example for further cultural heritage modeling research; 
Similar to this method, Guo Jiangning, Chen Nianqing, Sun Hao, et al. 
(2020) performed fusion modeling based on terrestrial 3D LiDAR tech-
nology and aerial photography to reconstruct high-precision complete 
3D models of ancient buildings. Wan Fei, et al. (2021) explored a fine 3D 
model of the ancient post road in Nanyue Based on the VR scene con-
struction, which provides new ideas for the digital preservation of his-
torical buildings. 
On the microscopic scale, Fang Wei, et al. (2015) corrected the 
murals through the laser point cloud intensity during the digital pres-
ervation of murals, which solved the problem of few feature points and 
uneven distribution in intensity image extraction; Zhao Rong (2016), Lv 
Wenxu, et al. (2016) of the Institute of Archaeology of the Dunhuang 
Academy used 3D LiDAR to collect images of Buddhist shrines and 
painted sculptures in Dunhuang Grottoes, serving the efficient and ac-
curate requirements of archaeological mapping; He Yan, et al. (2016) 
proposed the detection technology of ancient relief damaged area by 
laser beam scanning, and proved its advantages in the clarity and error 
control of scanned images; Hu Bengang, et al. (2016) used 3D laser point 
cloud data through reverse engineering. Carry out 3D modeling of 
physical cultural heritage, with the help of reverse engineering software 
such as PolyWorks, Geomagic, etc., automatically identify the physical 
cultural heritage features in 3D laser point cloud data, and automatically 
fit regular geometric elements to build a refined 3D model. The model 
has high accuracy and can be reaching the sub-millimeter level or above, 
fully meeting the accuracy requirements of cultural relic restoration; 
Wang Lele (2021) and Gao Yang (2021) explored the method of virtual 
restoration of damaged areas of cultural relics based on high-precision 
3D LiDAR models; the team of Dr. Professor Cao Yongkang of 
Shanghai Jiaotong University combined laser scanning measurement, 
infrared detection, stress wave tomography, Methods such as material 
analysis are applied in the preservation process of ancient bridges in 
Shanghai, and the monitoring of ancient bridges, disease detection, 
structural reinforcement and replacement of damaged components are 
realized through the application of various technologies. Similar prac-
tices at the micro-scale are also used in high-precision real texture 3D 
modeling of built heritage (Qi et al., 2021), 3D reconstruction of irreg-
ular cultural relics (Xi et al., 2020), etc. 
In addition to the above studies, Chinese scholars have also carried 
out research at different scales based on 3D LiDAR and multi-technology 
collaboration: 3D digital representation of Suzhou Tiger Hill Pagoda 
(Zhang et al., 2012), Jingjiang Royal Mausoleum (Zhou et al., 2015), 
Shichahai Lake Surrounding Mapping (Gao et al., 2021) and other 
heritage sites preservation research. Among scholars in other countries, 
Ortiz-Coder, et al. (2020) proposed a method for 3D reconstruction of 
heritage scenes using video measurement-based equipment, which is 
based on two cameras with different characteristics and adopts visual 
simultaneous localization and the combination of cartography (SLAM) 
and photogrammetry, VSLAM works with a series of filtering algorithms 
for the best selection of images and guarantees that users will not lose Table 2

7track during real-time data acquisition. Through case studies, evalua -
tions, and comparisons, it was found that the method is 17 times faster 
than laser scanners in capturing data, and the post-processing of the 
system is fully automatic but takes more time than laser scanners in post- 
processing. 
However, current research and preservation techniques have also 
brought to light a number of issues, including the dearth of recording 
information, the difficulty of collaboration, the non-standardization and 
fragmentation of data, the difficulty of data mining, and the difficulty of 
comprehensive utilization. There are still deficiencies in dynamic, three- 
dimensional, and refined aspects, which need to be further explored, 
such as, continuing to deepen the use of convolutional neural networks 
(CNN) for the image-based reconstruction of high-precision 3D heritage 
buildings and the overall environment; strengthening the detailed 
characteristics of built heritage and the refinement of structural recon -
struction; technology development of dynamic scene reconstruction of 
built heritage at different scales; innovative algorithms for the recon -
struction and evaluation of built heritage at different scales. 
6.2. Comprehensive application of built heritage preservation from 
multiple Perspectives, Integration, and High-Precision docking 
3D LiDAR technology and multi-technology collaboration continue 
to produce breakthroughs in different research issues, on the one hand, 
multi-view, high-precision, and point cloud annotation meet the re-
quirements of surveying and mapping accuracy and information accu-
racy for different types of built heritage. Technology enables researchers 
to quickly and accurately capture and reconstruct the geometry and 
color of built heritage; on the other hand, it has high comprehensive 
efficiency and low cost, improves the efficiency of modeling and digital 
storage, and breaks through the limitations of single technology appli -
cations. The docking of HBIM, VR, and CIM provides fine digital models, high-precision data benchmarks, and basic materials, which are highly 
targeted in the preservation of built heritage. 
From the perspective of preservation, Zhang Xu, et al. (2013) used 
3D LiDAR combined with CAD and 3D printing to explore the technical 
methods of reverse engineering restoration of cultural relics. Hong Kong 
scholar Siu Susanna Lai Kuen (2021) discussed the technical methods for 
the restoration of built heritage damaged by natural disasters, to ensure 
complete and faithful restoration. To solve the problem of digital pres-
ervation of built heritage, Li Minzhen, et al. (2015) adopted 3D LiDAR to 
reconstruct the historical buildings along the Huangpu River in 
Shanghai in a refined manner, and the models are managed by com-
ponents, to organize massive information and facilitate subsequent 
statistics and use. In response to the monitoring and management of 
built heritage, Zhou Wei, et al. (2012) used laser scanning technology to 
monitor the deformation of large-scale ancient buildings in the Foxiang 
Pavilion of the Summer Palace. 
From an evaluation perspective, Yin Yongsheng, et al. (2020) 
combined 3D LiDAR with deep learning to directly learn and extract the 
built heritage features from image data through deep learning based on 
constructing 3D virtual models and processing photo data; Multi- 
technology types researched 3D digital modeling technology for main -
taining infrastructure, especially the use of point cloud data, thinking 
about the transformation from infrastructure resilience management to 
structural maintenance, from 3D model to structural analysis, system 
cost, and a series of challenging issues such as massive data processing, 
the research has reference significance for the preservation practice of 
the built heritage of the historical urban area in terms of technical co-
ordination, flexible management, and structural maintenance. 
From the perspective of heritage management, scholars and 
practitioners of heritage preservation choose to use 3D digital surveying 
and mapping technologies such as close-range photogrammetry, 3D 
laser scanning, and multi-technology comprehensive surveying and

8mapping in combination with 3D information management technologies 
such as 3D geographic information system and information model to 
serve the fine, digital and dynamic management of built heritage. Such 
as Liang Huilin, et al. (2020) employed three-dimensional digital map-
ping and information technology to collect, process, store, manage, 
maintain, update and analyze data, serving the preservation, manage -
ment and sustainable use of garden heritage in China; Zhang Zhi, et al. 
(2021) discussed the construction of the information technology method 
framework for the preservation and utilization of the Great Wall cultural 
heritage, and advocated using the digital twin theory to design experi -
mental research and comparative analysis to summarize the technical 
methods for data collection of different types of Great Wall cultural 
heritage, such as multi-source remote sensing technology (aerospace 
remote sensing, unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing, multi-source 
ground detection), Internet of Things technology (dynamic collection, 
real-time communication, two-way interaction), GIS (Web GIS/Cloud 
GIS/Smart GIS), information simulation technology (GIM/LIM/BIM), 
virtual reality technology (VR/AR/MR), covering macro, meso and 
micro scales, 2D, 3D and 4D dimensions, and different components of 
physical entities, serve as the basic technical support for the intelligent 
preservation of the Great Wall cultural heritage, which is both a method 
of built heritage preservation and a means of heritage information 
management. 
From the lens of heritage perception, Dr. Professor Li Yuan (2020, 
2021, 2022) from Xiamen University and Xiamen Key Laboratory of 
Integrated Application of Intelligent Technology for Architectural Her-
itage Protection focuses on the value perception study of multi- 
dimensional built heritage, including old urban quarters, historic 
streets, historic urban landscapes, and historic buildings based on the 
collaboration of 3D LiDAR, UAV tilts photography, BIM, machine 
learning, virtual simulation, questionnaire, structural equation modeling (SEM), human performance experiments, and artificial intel-
ligence algorithm. In his study, through the quantitative analysis of built 
heritage combined with environmental psychology and human spatial 
behavior characteristics, his research evaluated the preference, cogni -
tion, and satisfaction of humans with the historical environmental in-
formation of heritage sites, and the feasible optimization strategies were 
proposed through a range of quantitative evaluation results. 
Along with the aforementioned four facets, existing research based 
on 3D LiDAR and multi-technology collaborative research on building 
contour identification, building settlement prediction, deformation 
monitoring, weathering monitoring, system life cycle health detection, 
building classification, building erection, rapid surface extraction, 3D 
dynamic image reconstruction, information feature matching research, 
non-destructive analysis technology research, data management, and 
visualization research, data acquisition, and structure storage optimi -
zation and other technologies have expanded the comprehensive 
application scope of built heritage preservation. Existing research and 
applications provide the basis for the following three technological in-
novations: (1) innovate the multi-modal image fusion 3D reconstruction 
technology, and effectively guide the precise restoration of micro-scale 
built heritage details or internal structures through visual information; 
(2) reconstruct the multi-scale adaptive built heritage environment 
based on robots and multi-modal fusion perception systems; (3) on 
different scales, continue to carry out the technical connection between 
rapid 3D reconstruction and real-time reconstruction based on the 
combination of 3D LiDAR and digital twin technology.

97.The built heritage preservation based on 3D LiDAR and Multi- 
Technology Collaboration: Future challenge and future 
technological application 
Innovative 3D digitization and geomatics approaches have emerged 
over the past few decades as non-invasive technologies in the field of 
cultural heritage, primarily to meet the demands of documentation, 
management, and protection (Di Stefano et al., 2021 ). The 3D LiDAR 
with its unique technical advantages plays an increasingly important 
role in the practice of digital recording, assessment, intervention, 
reparation, restoration, monitoring, optimization, improvement, etc. To 
go further, the future challenge and future technological application on 
built heritage preservation based on 3D LiDAR and multi-technology 
collaboration focus on four parts: 
(1) 3D LiDAR interfaces with digital recording and artificial intelli -
gence in the field of built heritage preservation and integrates with 
multiple sources of heterogeneous data, leading to the digitization and 
virtualization of the whole element (Lu et al., 2021), real-time and 
visualization of the full state, and provides visualized, analyzable, 
computable, and three-dimensional work paths and specific technolo -
gies that bridge the differences in the depth and mode of work re-
quirements. For example, image recognition, feature extraction, 
linguistic analysis, algorithms, simulation analysis (control data and 
change of conditions, inversion of change processes), identification of 
risk points at different scales (fire, flood, mountain seepage, weathering, 
constructive damage, human damage, improper restoration) and sensi-
tivity, vulnerability prediction (combining close-up photogrammetry, 
hyperspectral imaging techniques, thermal imaging of walls, ultrasonic 
techniques to map building painting and frescoes, telemetry of concrete 
surface defects, structural material properties, and toughness, structural 
damage, settlement, deformation, stains, and mould; combined with 
GNSS and high-sensitivity remote sensing analysis to achieve large-scale 
architectural heritage disaster information collection and collaborative 
observation, to enhance the disaster prevention and response capability 
of architectural heritage conservation), etc. Facing the needs of built 
heritage preservation in three-dimensional health monitoring and 
management, risk prediction, preservation planning, design and con-
struction, operation optimization, interactive feedback from the heri-
tage Internet of Things, comprehensive spatial analysis, and scientific 
decision-making, serving the dynamic conservation of multi-scale 
architectural heritage space and intelligent governance of heritage sites. 
(2) based on the preservation of the physical space of the built her-
itage, it turns to the perception calculation of the intangible level of the 
built heritage. Through multi-technology collaboration, while preser -
ving the built heritage, it explores the relationship among the built 
heritage, its value, and people, so that information, systems, and models 
can be interconnected with social behavior and spatial environment, 
develop from one-way heritage information collection, analysis, and 
release to multi-dimensional information interaction, strengthen 
human-landscape interaction, and quantitatively express cognition, 
emotion, memory, preference, attachment, etc., and serve for the long- 
term goal of people-centered adaptive reuse and development, it will 
feed back into the preservation of the physical space of architectural 
heritage while improving the experience of local communities and 
tourists. 
(3) 3D laser scanning and multi-technology synergy will be more 
useful in the direction of informatization, digitization, and wisdom of 
architectural heritage conservation, with potential applications in inte-
grating cultural and historical information of architectural heritage, 
developing new tools to store and share all relevant metadata, building 
an open and shared cultural heritage information model (CHIM), heri-
tage big data platform, 3D visualization platform (3DGIS), regional 
heritage management information platform, 5G AR remote visuali -
zation expert system, and Heritage Intelligent System (HIS) for historical 
heritage conservation. Through the construction of the platform, long- 
period, multi-scale, multi-dimensional information collection, spatio- temporal data mining and analysis, monitoring and evaluation, and 
management applications are realized to serve a high-quality, refined, 
integrated, and collaborative paradigm of comprehensive architectural 
heritage conservation practices. For example, by combining digital vir-
tual restoration design and 3D printing technology, we can simulate 
traditional craft forms to repair and restore the structural components, 
skin texture, and key features of architectural heritage to achieve the 
continuation of the authenticity and integrity of heritage. 
(4) The interface between 3D laser scanning and intelligent media 
technology is also a noteworthy development and trend. Combining 
digital elevation models based on 3D laser scanning, model presentation 
films with 5G, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed re-
ality (MR), big data mining and knowledge discovery to create immer -
sive, intelligent and interactive experiences in the following ways: First, 
it is applied to simulate different scenarios of economic, social and 
environmental development, responding to different needs of architec -
tural heritage conservation and all aspects of multi-situational simula -
tion; second, it is applied to the use of digital museum displays (digital 
reproduction) and cultural exhibitions under the perspective of experi -
ence economy, for example, the overall effect formed by combining with 
3D dome technology and NPC interaction to improve the interpretation 
and display dissemination of built heritage; Third, bringing more 
experiential autonomy and cultural production possibilities in the 
context of cultural tourism integration, moving from information ser-
vices to knowledge services, realising heritage education from a cultural 
empowerment perspective, metaverse-based time travel, story maps and 
digital product development, cultural IP development and trans -
formation, etc. 
8.Conclusion 
This literature review focuses on the use of 3D LiDAR in the field of 
built heritage preservation of various scenarios through a multidisci -
plinary lens. It provides a thorough survey on 3D LiDAR and multi- 
technology collaboration that contains the hotspots and methods, their 
application, future challenge, and future technological application in 
built heritage sites. 
Reviewing the cases of 3D LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration 
in the existing study, it can be found that the technology presents a 
diversified trend in the application, and the combination with other 
technology types can also provide effective feedback through the anal-
ysis of specific problems. It is important to note that the practice of 
integrating with digital twins, artificial intelligence, multi-source het-
erogeneous data, and data platform construction is not included in the 
existing research cases of 3D LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration, 
and the practice of combining big data and machine learning is still in its 
infancy. Few studies have also focused on how individual behavior and 
perception experiences (whether virtual or real) relate to 3D LiDAR and 
multi-technology collaboration, which emphasizes the limitations and 
shortcomings of these two fields in the age of artificial intelligence, big 
data, and the metaverse. 
In the future, 3D LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration will be 
more in-depth to guarantee a sustainable and promising preservation 
outcome. Although the current practice of built heritage protection is 
constantly based on 3D LiDAR to solve more problems of built heritage 
preservation, there is no doubt that the comprehensive changes brought 
about by the above new technologies will be an important thrust for the 
further development of 3D LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration 
over time.
